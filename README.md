# GSOR-and-MTAO
Code for Genetic Score Omics Regression (GOSR) and multi-trait meta-analyses of omics-associations (MTAO)

GSOR is a method that associates assayed gene expression with genetically predicted phenotype, i.e., genetic score. MTAO is a summary-data-based method that combines effects on complex traits of omics features such as genes or introns. Please check README_GSOR.md and README_MTAO.md for details on how to run these two analyses with code and test datasets.
